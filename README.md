##  Project Overview
This project is designed to automatically protect clothes from unexpected rainfall.  
When rain is detected, the system activates a servo motor to move the clothes to a safe position and alerts the user using LEDs and a buzzer.  
The project is built using Arduino Uno and basic electronic components.



## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Rain Sensor Module  
- Servo Motor  
- LEDs  
- Buzzer  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper Wires  
- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C / C++



##  Features
- Automatic rain detection  
- Servo motor based clothes protection  
- Buzzer alert on rain detection  
- LED indication  
- Automatic reset when rain stops  
- Low cost and easy to implement  



##  How to Run Project
1. Connect all components as per the circuit
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Connect Arduino Uno using USB cable
4. Upload the provided Arduino code
5. Place rain sensor in open area
6. Pour water on sensor to test the system



## 🔌 Components Connection
- Rain Sensor → Digital Pin 2  
- Servo Motor → Digital Pin 9  
- Buzzer → Digital Pin 8
